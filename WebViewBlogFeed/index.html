              <div class="item-date">19 Jan</div> 
              <p>
                 November, the month of lights, holidays and of course, no shaving. It is the month, where men start off with smooth, baby cheeks and end up looking much similar to a chimpanzee, or the likes. So what is 'No shave November'? </p>
                <br>
                <p>There are possibly two ways to answer this question. </p>
                <br>
                <p>
Ask a teenager, and he will ignorantly tell you about it being the month to Snapchat daily images of progressively growing beards, or God forbid, tweet #LetItGrow, for a duration or 30 days, without once ever stopping to think about the whys and the whats. Many would dare to say it is for cancer, but have you ever stopped to ponder over how your blessed moustache would do any good in the world? </p>
                <br>
                <p>The act of not shaving a whole month was essentially started to create awareness of men's health issues, such as depression in men, prostate cancer and other male cancers, and associated charities. The movement is a way for us, to aid cancer patients in their struggles by refraining from grooming our beards, and instead directing that money to cancer associations, like the American Cancer society. </p>
                <br>
                <p>This is not only limited to men. Women can undeniably do their bit, by skipping a visit to the salon and instead donating this money to cancer associations. 
The cause albeit noble, is being overlooked by us people as being irrelevant, as opposed to its social importance. 
The herd mentality of blindly following the latest fad has reached such high levels of absurdity, where teenagers are willing to throw buckets full of ice cold water on themselves, without once giving a hoot about the social significance of such, otherwise ludicrous acts. 
Regardless of whether you shave or not, pitch in a little, support the moment and donate. Participate in the moment with the complete knowledge of how one small act can create an avalanche effect. After all, growing a 'mo' on its own, never helped no patient.</p>

              <p>Dear Moon Fairy,</p>
                <p>Thank you for putting so much faith in me and having all the patience in the world. This one's for you. I love you. :'&#41;</p>
                <br>
                <p>A lot of us say that love is over rated. But is it really the case? We say love alone can not keep us alive, but would you rather live or just stay alive?? These two terms sound so similar, yet bear such huge differences. You might be the Christian Grey with a jaw dropping fortress in Escala, but what good is it without Anastasia Steele to share it? You see, love is never going to buy you things, but is is always going to bring in the little fragments of magic your life will need. You never know how much bliss two people might find in each other even if they look like they can never co-exist. An extremely bizarre analogy would be the solar cooker and the sun. No one can look at the sun directly without being blinded, nothing can endure the blistering heat it exudes without breaking a sweat and no one, can take it all in like the cooker. It just makes the cooker stronger, that's how the sun belongs to the cooker. And I absolutely agree that this is the most absurd analogy you'll ever come across with reference to love.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>We're all aware of the fabled relationship the moon and the werewolf share. It is said that the moon brings out the wolf inside the human. But what would happen if the insanely carefree and lone wolf is wonder-struck by the beauty of the moon? What if the wolf is so enthralled by the enchantress that he regains his sanity only to cherish and love the moon for his life? There might be a thousand stars shining gazillion times brighter, but for him, the radiance of the moon is invincible.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>And yes, the moon did have her admirers, but none like the wolf. She was his happy place. She knew for all the tranquility she was full of, she loved the havoc he created in her heart. She loved how despite being wild and untamed he would try to be the perfect human just for her. He carried darker secrets in his heart which were only for her to see. And from shining full and brightest in the skies, she'd readily wane all the way, just for him. It isn't about all the melancholic times they've shared, but all about the times they've shared in contentment. Its about the times they spent as part time lovers, full time friends. Because no love, is complete without friendship. It is obvious that the wolf and moon getting together is rather impossible, but sometimes, we just have to believe in magic. No, not the kind where the pigeon flies out of the magician's hat, but the kind which turns our lives around. The moon asked the sun, how was she so sure that the wolf and her would make it till forever and beyond?? Here's what the sun had to say, ” Sweetheart, there is too much solicitude that you both have for each other. So much affection, that it can not be denied. You both are in the loop which looks like the lemniscate. Like towards the centre, you might go different ways at times, but after a while, your trajectories will meet again and again, and again. And there is no end to this loop, for, it goes on just the way it is, *infinite*. You might not see it, but deep in your heart, you know you belong to no one but each other. Have patience, because there will be a day when all of the animal world and the celestial world would come together to celebrate the day you shall unite. And that you shall have tiny radiant bunnies who'll grow up to tenacious direwolves. It is never going to be perfect in the yes of the world, but if it feels like the picture perfect fit, then that's all you need. When you know there is only one soul that rules yours, there is no other kingdom you'd have to go. When you know that only you know the sorcery that spellbinds him, there exists no other spell that could separate you. That is how I know that you're going to be together forever and beyond .That is how you're in love, and that, is how you're enchanted. <3

                <p>I must have been 6 or 7, gleefully trying out my elder sister's and mother's heels, impatiently waiting for the day I'd get to wear those beauties for real.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Fast forward 12 years, and I'm teetering on those very heels in the most unladylike fashion, heading off in unintended directions to maintain my balance, and also living in constant paranoia of spraining an ankle or stepping on some poor soul's foot!</p>
                <br>
                <p>So why are women all over the world forsaking their comfort and a pain free life for the high heel? And which smart alec came up with the idea in the first place?</p>
                <br>
                <p>It may surprise you, but the high heel was originally meant for men. It was an instrument of war rather than seduction (come to think of it, they can still be used to direly cause hurt).</p>
                <br>
                <p>15th century Persian soldiers used the heel to secure their feet in stirrups for greater leverage with their bow and arrow as they went galloping into battle (by the end of the sixteenth century, the Persian army was the largest in the world). As Persian messengers traveled to Europe, they took their heels with them, which immediately caught the fancy of European male aristocrats. They realized wearing high heels prevented their feet from coming into contact with say, horse droppings and other muck on the streets of the Renaissance city. And oh, it made them look so much taller and intimidating. The heel was not meant to be pretty, it was meant to be scary! (they still are by the way) By the 18th century, heels were one of the biggest power symbols until the French revolution, when democracy became the new fashion. They were completely done away with, until the 20th century when porn photographers realized that heels made women's bodies look great! Then, there was no looking back.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Technology, ever since, has made heels more stable and easier to wear (hahaha). And although they put a lot of stress on the lower back, cause bunions and painful bone deformities of the foot with excess use and cause embarrassing falls at times, they make a woman feel beautiful, more powerful and confident. Living the high heeled life requires skill and panache. After all, they aren't called killer heels for nothing!</p>

                <div class="item-date">5 Feb</div> 
              <p>When we use the word 'Freedom' whenever we interact , it's implied that freedom may be of several types. And then there's Freedom of Speech!</p><br>
              <p>Well, as history reveals, many civilizations emerged, sustained and at some point of time were annihilated ! But, as it goes, one might successfully suppress a human physically, but one can never suppress anyone's thoughts! That's where the concept of so called 'Freedom of Speech' kicks off.</p><br>
                <p>And nowadays,there have been several unsuccessful attempts to suppress this entity! The civilizations which I talked about might have existed hundreds of years ago! But, the practice hasn't yet culminated, even in the 15th year of the 21st century!</p><br>
                <p>Yes, I'm certainly referring to the recent attacks on some satirical newspaper! According to the saying 'Pen is mightier than the sword' ! This is the universal truth and any attempts, to prove it wrong would certainly be futile.</p><br>
                <p>The attacks were surely condemnable. One didn't simply attack that particular organization, but one attacked 'Freedom of Speech' on a whole! When we realise this , we ourselves are pained! Majority of the countries across the globe have embraced 'democracy' .And this democracy runs on the principles of 'equality,liberty and fraternity'</p><br>
                <p>One can't simply take away these authorities from us by any means! The ones trying to do so would get overpowered!</p><br>
                <p>And in the 21st century, when the world is reaping the fruits of democracy,the mindset has to change! Several forms of governance emerged, and have been rejected massively! Those who are trying to propagate the failed forms of governance yet again , such anarchists would get overpowered easily!</p><br>
                <p>This was something which I really felt like expressing, after all , even I enjoy my freedom of speech!</p>

              <p>Manto, one of the greatest writers the world would never know once wrote this about Bombay, 'You can be happy here on two pennies a day or on ten thousand rupees a day, if you wish. You can also spend your life here as the unhappiest man in the world. You can do what you want. No one will find fault with you. Nor will anyone subject you to moralizing. You alone will have to accomplish the most difficult of tasks and you alone will have to make the most difficult decision of your life. You may live on the footpath or in a magnificent palace. If it never knew you came, it'll never know you left.'</p><br>
                <p>Strangers, impossibilities, opportunity and collapse brush shoulders, tomorrow can bring anything. Wealth, insanity, anything. And yesterday is an ancient as 1700. Perhaps it is this idea of anything happening tomorrow that keeps Mumbaikars running.</p>
                <br>
                <p>A friend of mine who Studies in Aachen, Germany says for Days, sometimes weeks, she can tell what her next day will be like - and it will be exactly like the previous one. There's a system, a routine, the local Breakfast diner, her College, the morning train at 8:47. Yes, there's change in her Life, but nothing that isn't foreseen.</p>
                <br>
                <p>There's her Assignments, the semester exams, the chocolate indulgence on the commute home, the occasional party she attends. Excluding acts of god, freakish weather and an emergency or two, life has a pattern - a known system. The train comes on time, her hostel in some quiet leafy suburb has no infrastructure collapse daily. The next 2 years, even though they can't be predicted, can be assumed.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I heard this and was in awe. Not because I thought this was some great life (it seemed a bit boring actually), but when I heard of the repetition of everyday, it was like someone was telling me about Santa Claus for the first time. As someone who has lived in Mumbai all his life, I've never had one minute the same as the next, let alone days. We couldn't predict the next 11 seconds, let alone the next few years. Nobody, not one person, in the world lives like us, Tribals in the amazon who live and hunt in the trees seem 9 to 5 compared to us.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Isaac Asimov in his many predictions once said that there would be a society in the future, if taken out of their comfort zone of chaos, would not know how to socially function in other environments.</p>
                <br>
                <p>As Mumbaikars, we're it.</p>
